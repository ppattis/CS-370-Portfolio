# CS-370-Portfolio


## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project we were given a skeleton code with some of the basic setup work completed.  We had to implement the Q-Learning algorithm.  The point of the smart agent was to find the shortest path through a maze to find a treasure.  The concept being that we were programming an Artificial Intelligence Non-player Character for a treasure hunt game.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer Scientists research and develop algorithms to solve problems with a computer.  Computer Scientists will also implement those algorithms and develop computer programs.
        
### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
My approach to a problem as a computer scientist is to first try and break the problem up as much as possible.  Turning a complex problem into multiple smaller, easier problems.  After the problem is distilled down into its base problems, then programming the solution becomes easier.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities to the end user is more or less a do no harm type.  My programs should do what they are advertised to do and nothing else.  It should solve the problem the user wants solved, and not harm the users hardware, or the user themselves.  My ethical responsibilities to the organization is to do the job within budget, both time and money, and deliver software that satisfies all the requirements with as few bugs as possible.
